# Trump Bot

This is bot trained on Donald Trumpâ€™s vocabulary, i.e. text from his tweets and speeches. It is a Markov model 
that utters Trump-like sentences, given a particular word or phrase. When given a phrase it randomly selects a 
work and utters a sentence. Click [here](http://whatwouldtrumpsay.elasticbeanstalk.com/) for the app.  

This is work in progress, and so the code is unclean. I will add more details soon.
